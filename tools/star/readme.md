# STAR Indexer

A reusable module that uses STAR program to pre-index the reference before running a given data pipeline.
Each run generates a unique log file that contains useful information about the dataset and the version of the tool
used to generate the indexes.

The module was created to run either as a standalone application or as a downstream process of index trigger applications.
