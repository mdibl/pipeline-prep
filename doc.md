# About This Project

Pipeline-prep project's goal is in two folds - first creates a set reusable modules used in running the first step of a given data pipeline then create and automation to run the pre-indexing step. 

The goals :
  1) Pre-Indexing reference genome/transcripome
  2) Automate Pre-indexing step
  ```
    a) Create a trigger to index a New Data version 
    b) Create a trigger to index a New Tool version 
  ```
  3) Pre-processing the reads.
  

## Pre-Indexing reference genome/transcripome

Indexes are created by tool version -> data source version > organism-dataset. Each data source specifies
data format for a given dataset and each tool has its own sets of command to index the reference data.

The root directory of the project contains two main diretories:

 * tools
 * data_sources
 
  See:

### The Data Sources Directory

Each data source is config file (tool.cfg) under data_sources/  - Each config file contains the following 
global environment variables:
  1) DATASETS - Mapping between each dataset and its file format 
  2) GENOME - AN ARRAY of the names of datasets that are genomic (the whole genome) - used as a flag for indexing options
  3) DATA_SOURCE - name of the data source
  4) ORGANISMS - list of organism as provived (datasets are stored by organisms)
  5) and more
  
#### Data Sources Used To Test
  1) Ensembl
  2) Wormbase
  
### The Tools Directory

Each tool is a directory under tools  and each directory contains the following files:

1)	A readme.md file
2)	A config file tool.cfg
3)	Refeence.csv file mapping tool to datasets - one reference.csv file for each data source
4)	The Index shell script to setup and index datasets

#### The Tool.cfg Config File
Each tool's config file contains global environment variables ranging from the tool local install path, datasets path,
tool indexes path,to index options.
  1) Tool Local Install config
  ```
     PACKAGE_INSTALL_BASE  - path to tool install directory
     TOOL_VERSION - name of the directory created by the indexer for this version of the tool
     INDEX_BASE  -- path to where indexes are stored
  ```
  2) Path To Datasets and logs
  ```
     FASTA_BASE -- path to datasets fasta files
     LOGS_BASE  -- path to logs generated by this tool
     
  ```
  3) Indexer config
  ```
     REFERENCE_FILE -- a list of reference.csv files indexed bu this tool - one for each data source
     TOOL_INDEX_EXEC -- the indexer (the executable)
     ALGO_GENOME  -- indexer option for genome indexing (bwa)
     ALGO_TRANSCRIPTOME -- indexer option for transcriptome indexing
     
  ```
